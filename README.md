# homework

## Lesson 1

The homework for the C# course consists of four tasks.

Write a program that:

* Task 2: takes two numbers as input and outputs which number is greater and which is less.
* Task 4: takes three numbers as input and outputs the maximum of those numbers.
* Task 6: takes a number as input and outputs whether the number is even (whether it is divisible by two without a remainder).
* Task 8: that takes a number (N) as input and shows all even numbers from 1 to N as output.

## Lesson 2

Write a program that:
* Task 10: takes a three-digit number as input and shows the second digit of that number as output. (Use only mathematical operations, you cannot use number as a string of type number[1])
* Task 13: outputs the third digit of a given number or tells you that there is no third digit.
* Task 15: takes a digit representing a day of the week as input and checks if it is a day off.
